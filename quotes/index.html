        <p>Here is a collection of some quotes which express ideas that I found either
insightful or at least entertaining.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Chuck Close’s advice (replace art with research where applicable). Sometimes
difficult to follow, but the method is almost always surprisingly effective.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Inspiration is for amateurs — the rest of us just show up and get to
work. And the belief that things will grow out of the activity itself and
that you will — through work — bump into other possibilities and kick open
other doors that you would never have dreamt of if you were just sitting
around looking for a great “art idea.” And the belief that process, in a
sense, is liberating and that you don’t have to reinvent the wheel every
day. Today, you know what you’ll do, you could be doing what you were doing
yesterday, and tomorrow you are gonna do what you did today, and at least
for a certain period of time you can just work. <strong>If you hang in there, you
will get somewhere.</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paul Dirac on what is important.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>When you ask what are electrons and protons I ought to answer that this
question is not a profitable one to ask and does not really have a meaning.
<strong>The important thing about electrons and protons is not what they are but how
they behave, how they move.</strong> I can describe the situation by comparing it to
the game of chess. In chess, we have various chessmen, kings, knights, pawns
and so on. If you ask what chessman is, the answer would be that it is a piece
of wood, or a piece of ivory, or perhaps just a sign written on paper, or
anything whatever. It does not matter. Each chessman has a characteristic way
of moving and this is all that matters about it. The whole game os chess
follows from this way of moving the various chessmen.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Friedrich Nietzsche on science.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>On the whole, scientific methods are at least as important as any other result
of research</strong>: for it is upon the insight into method that the scientific spirit
depends: and if these methods were lost, then all the results of science could
not prevent a renewed triumph of superstition and nonsense. Clever people may
learn as much as they wish of the results of science - still one will always
notice in their conversation, and especially in their hypotheses, that they
lack the scientific spirit; <strong>they do not have that instinctive mistrust of the
aberrations of thought which through long training are deeply rooted in the
soul of every scientific person.</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Terry Gannon on benefits and downsides of category theory (from <a href="http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9780511535116">Moonshine Beyond the Monster</a>).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Category theory is intended as a universal language of mathematics, so all
concepts should be translated into it. Much as beavers, who as a species
hate the sound of running water, plaster a creek with mud and sticks until
alas that cursed tinkle stops, so do category theorists devise elaborate
and obscure definitions in an attempt to capture a concept that to most of
us seemed perfectly clear before they got to it. <strong>But at least sometimes
this works admirably</strong> – for instance no one can be immune to the charm of
treating knot invariants with braided monoidal categories.</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>This generality of course comes with a price: it can wash away all of the
endearing special features of a favourite theory or structure. There
certainly are contexts where, for example, all human beings should be
considered equal, but there are other contexts where the given human is
none other than your mother and must be treated as such.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Julian Havel on “elementary” and “simple” (from <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7494.html">Gamma: Exploring Euler’s Constant</a>).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Mathematics makes a nice distinction between the usually synonymous terms
“elementary” and “simple”, with “elementary” taken to mean that not very
much mathematical knowledge is needed to read the work and “simple” to mean
that not very much mathematical ability is needed to understand it. In these
terms we think the content is often elementary but in places not so very
simple. The reader should expect to make use of pen and paper in many
places; mathematics is not a spectator sport!</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2221">Scott Aarson on what is wrong with Twitter</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Incidentally, this is one reason why I haven’t gotten a
Twitter account: while it has many worthwhile uses, it’s also a medium that
might as well have been designed for mobs, for ganging up, for
status-seeking among allies stripped of rational arguments.  It’s like the
world’s biggest high school.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paul Dirac being Paul Dirac.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by
everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in the case of poetry,
it’s the exact opposite!</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boromir (paraphrasing Euclid (probably™)).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>One does not simply walk into Mordor.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>There is no royal road to geometry.</p>
    </blockquote>
