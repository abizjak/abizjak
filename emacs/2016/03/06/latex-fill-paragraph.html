    <p>When using version control and collaborating with others it is useful<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> to
structure the file so that each sentence is in its own line. This way it is
often easier to see what changes others have made in the diffs.</p>

<p>In Emacs one often uses <code>M-q</code>, which is the <code>fill-paragaph</code> function. This
refills (or reflows<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>) the paragraph so that it is no more than <code>fill-column</code>
characters wide. The problem with using it though is that if one changes even a
small thing in one sentence, the whole paragraph will typically need to be
refilled and each line will be changed. As a consequence, the diff in the
version control commit will look as if the whole paragraph was potentially
changed. This is terrible, horrible, abominable behavior<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The way to fix it is to redefine <code>M-q</code> to fill the paragraph in such a way that
each sentence is on its own line. Immediately a question and a problem appears.
What <em>is</em> a <em>sentence</em>? We are in luck. Emacs developers have seen it prudent to
think long and hard about just this problem and have blessed us with functions
<code>forward-sentence</code> and <code>backward-sentence</code> which are just what we need.</p>

<p>The plan is as follows. We will bind the shortcut <code>M-q</code> to the function
<code>ales/fill-paragraph</code> defined below. This function will first put the whole
paragraph that we are currently in into a single line. Then it will use
<code>forward-sentence</code> to jump through the sentences and split the paragraph into
lines consisting of sentences. What could be easier?</p>

<p>Then I just bind this function to <code>M-q</code> in <code>latex-mode</code> by doing</p>

<p>And we are done. Easy peasy. This almost always™ works correctly, but sometimes
Emacs gets confused as to what a sentence is.</p>

<p>Here it is in action.
