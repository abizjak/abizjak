<p>The students will read the following material:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chapters 1-6 of ‚ÄúSheaves in Geometry and Logic: A First Introduction to Topos Theory‚Äù by Saunders MacLane and Ieke Moerdijk</li>
  <li>Sections 1-3 of the paper ‚ÄúFirst Steps In Synthetic Guarded Domain Theory:
Step-Indexing In The Topos Of Trees‚Äù which is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3596">arXiv</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="meeting-schedule">Meeting schedule</h1>

<p>We generally meet every second Wednesday at 09:00, starting February 7th.
We meet in Lars‚Äô office, or alternatively in Turing-230 if Lars is busy.</p>

<h3 id="mm-ch-i"><strong>MM Ch. I</strong></h3>

<p>Generally all of the chapter is relevant. The only part which is not very
important for the applications we are considering is the example of continuous
G-sets.</p>

<p>With that in mind Exercises 6 and 7 are not very relevant.</p>

<h4 id="notes-from-the-meeting-on-feb-7"><strong>Notes from the meeting on Feb 7</strong></h4>

<p>The students should do the following.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To understand the relationship between (pre)sheaves and logic you should refresh
your understanding of how logic is modelled in hyperdoctrines by reading our <a href="http://cs.au.dk/~abizjak/documents/publications/categorical-logic-tutorial-notes.pdf">lecture notes</a>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Show that for any small category ‚ÑÇ, the subobjects functor</p>

    <p>Sub : PSh(‚ÑÇ)·µí·µñ ‚Üí Set</p>

    <p>gives rise to a hyperdoctrine as defined in the lecture notes.
In particular solve exercise I.10 in MM, writing out the constructions explicitly</p>
  </li>
  <li>Consider the special case of the previous item when ‚ÑÇ = œâ, the poset of
natural numbers with the usual ordering.
Re-read about the later modality in the categorical logic tutorial notes, and
show that the later modality can be soundly interpreted in PSh(œâ).
In particular show the soundness of L√∂b rule.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mm-ch-ii"><strong>MM Ch. II</strong></h3>

<p>Generally you can skip section 3 on sheaves and manifolds. While the examples
described therein are interesting for a variety of reasons, they are not so
relevant in the context of modelling logic.</p>

<p>Similarly section 7 on sheaves with algebraic structure is not so relevant for
now.</p>

<p>In general if your topology is a bit rusty then the connections between
different presentations of sheaves (sections 4-6) are going to be difficult to
understand. If you have trouble understanding some detail do not worry. Later on
the notion of a sheaf will be generalized and made more abstract, and the
relevant properties proved at this higher level of abstraction.
So do not spend too much time on these sections.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the more concrete presentations are useful for understanding the
more abstract ones.</p>

<p>Exercises 3, 5, 8, 10, and 11 are not too relevant. The rest are good practice.</p>

<h4 id="notes-from-the-meeting-on-feb-21"><strong>Notes from the meeting on Feb 21</strong></h4>

<p>Until the next meeting the students will continue working through chapter II.
To soldify their understanding they will work out the details of the following.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Write out the hyperdoctrine arising from the category Sh(X) of sheaves over a
topological space X. Reflect on how the interpretation of the logical
connectives differs from the hyperdoctrine arising from PSh(ùìû(X)), of
presheaves on the poset of open on the space X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let œâ√óœâ be the poset ‚Ñï √ó ‚Ñï ordered lexicographically.
œâ√óœâ can be turned into a topological space by equipping it with the (lower)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandrov_topology">Alexandrov topology</a>,
where the opens are exactly the downwards closed sets.</p>

    <p>Specialize the constructions from the previous item to the category Sh(œâ√óœâ).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Show that the Sh(œâ√óœâ)-based hyperdoctrine from the previous item models a
later operation ‚ñ∑ which is monotone, satisfies the L√∂b rule, and commutes
with ‚àß.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Show that the topos of trees based hyperdoctrine validates the
following logical property:</p>

    <p>‚ñ∑‚àÉ n : ‚Ñï, œï ‚ä¢ ‚àÉ n : ‚Ñï, ‚ñ∑ œï</p>

    <p>where the denotation of the ‚Ñï is the constant presheaf of natural numbers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Show that the property in the previous item fails in the Sh(œâ√óœâ)-based
hyperdoctrine. Here the denotation of ‚Ñï is the <em>constant sheaf</em> of natural
numbers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="notes-from-the-meeting-on-mar-7"><strong>Notes from the meeting on Mar 7</strong></h4>

<p>Until the next meeting the students will work through chapter III, and
investigate a particular sheaf topos.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Consider a partial commutative monoid M as defined in the lecture notes on
categorical logic. Let ‚âº be the ‚Äúdivisibility‚Äù preorder, i.e., x ‚âº y iff there
is a z such that y = x ¬∑ z. Consider the (upwards) Alexandrov topology on M,
i.e., the opens are the upwards closed sets.</p>

    <p>Investigate the sheaf topos Sh(M). In particular investigate whether the
canonical hyperdoctrine is a BI-hyperdoctrine in the sense of lecture
notes on categorical logic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mm-ch-iii"><strong>MM Ch. III</strong></h3>

<p>Sections 3 and 9 of the chapter are not important, and you can skip them.
In some of the other sections there are some references to the Zariski topology
(which is explained in Section 3), so you should just ignore that.</p>
